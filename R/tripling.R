#'Creates a New Design Matrix with Generating Equations
#' 
#' This function takes in a system of equations and an orginal design matrix. The output will be a new design matrix of three times the size of the orginal. This acts very similar to triple_fold but how it goes about exapnding the orgiinal design matrix is different in view points (but can be shown to be exactly equivalent).

#'@export
#' 
#'@param design_matrix The original design matrix that you would like expanded upon, must come in coded with 0,1,2's
#'@param l The system of equations. There must be f-1 equations for f being the number of factors. This should come in as a matrix with a unique, independent equation on each row. Each element of each equation must be coded 0, 1, or 2. 
#' 
#'@return  This will return a list of two parts
#'\item{Aliased_with_Fraction}{These are the effects that are still confounded with the intercept}
#'\item{Design_Matrix}{This is a matrix that is coded 0,1,2 that is the triple foldover created new Design Matrix that is 3 times the size of the orginal design matrix.}
