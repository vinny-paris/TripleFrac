#' Alias Structure Identifier
#' Returns what fraction is the matix is split along be warned that it only pays attention to fully aliased situations so if only 2 of three levels appear the function will not flag them you have been warned. 
#' @export
#' @param design_matrix This is the design matrix that is of interest. Each column is for the factors and each row for the treatments. Needs to be a matrix or data.frame.
#' @return This will return a matrix with one column (entitiled Aliased with Intercept) and rows corresponding to the effects confounded with the intercept.
