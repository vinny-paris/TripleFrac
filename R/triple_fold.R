#' Generating a New Design Matrix
#' 
#' Create the new design matrix from a triple foldover techinque using a rotation vector
#'
#' @export
#' 
#' @param design_matrix The original design matrix that you would like expanded upon, must come in coded with 0,1,2's
#' @param rotation_vector The rotation vector with the same length as the column width of the design matirx. Entries may be 0, 1, or 2.
#' 
#' @return  This will return a list of two parts
#' \item{Aliased_with_Fraction}{These are the effects that are still confounded with the intercept}
#' \item{Design_Matrix}{This is a matrix that is coded 0,1,2 that is the triple foldover created new Design Matrix that is 3 times the size of the orginal design matrix.}

#' design <- matrix(c(1,2,1,0,1,1,1,2,2), byrow = TRUE, nrow = 3)
#' x <- c(1, 2, 0)
#' triple_fold(design, x)
