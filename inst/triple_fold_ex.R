#This function returns what is aliased with the intercept in the design. There is a big caveat that this
#is only effective for regular fractions. It can take in irregular fractions and return things but it 
#cannot tell the difference between all levels present vs only 2 out of 3 levels present. It always returns 
#things that are completely confounded with the intercept and are constants through the whole design

# Fun time!! So x is your original design matrix coded with 0,1,2. The other variable 'expansion' is
#the vector for factor rotations. It must have the same length as the number of factors and in sequential
#ordering you may put in a 0, 1, or 2. A 0 will leave the factor unchanged thorugh the folding process.
#A one will shift the factor up 1 level, and a 2 will shift it up by two levels.
