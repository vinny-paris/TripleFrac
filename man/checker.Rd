\title{Test for optimal rotation vectors}
\usage{
checker(g, rotation_vector)
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{A matrix. This is the coded psuedo-design matrix with each element being 0, 1, or 2. Each row corresponds to one generator.}

\item{rotation_vector}{This is the rotation vector that is to be evaluated.}
}
\value{
A List. 
\item{rotation vector}{This is the vector you put in from the parameters}
}
\description{
For some set of generators, this function will show what the corresponding effect the rotation vector will have on it. Most importantly if the effects level come out to be 0 then it is rotationally tolerant.

\examples{
\dontrun{

q <- c(1, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0,
      0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2,

       0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1,

q <- matrix(q, nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE)
